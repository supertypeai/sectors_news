    "body": "The Straits Times Index reached a new high of 4,923.02 on Jan 27, prompting JPMorgan to raise its 2026 target to 6,000 (6,500 in a bull case) on the back of upbeat earnings expectations, a firm Singapore dollar and dividend appeal, with top picks DBS, UOL and Keppel. The rally extended to small\u2011 and mid\u2011cap stocks, boosting trading turnover and lifting shares of companies such as CSE Global, Nam Cheong, Ho Bee Land, Skylink Holdings, Don Agro International (now UpHealth Group) and Mirxes, while upcoming earnings reports and the Fed chair nomination could add volatility.",
