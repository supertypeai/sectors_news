            News Article Scoring Criteria (0-100). But with bonus point can goes up to 135.

            Tier 0: Noise / Irrelevant (Score 0-10)
            - Description: The news has no discernible connection to the Indonesian market, specific IDX companies, or relevant economic factors. 
              It is generic, trivial, or completely off-topic.
            - Example: "A foreign celebrity launched a new clothing line. The event was attended by many fans."

            Tier 1: General Context (Score 11-40)
            - Description: The news provides general background information about the Indonesian economy, a broad market sector, or global trends that have a weak or indirect link to the IDX. 
              It lacks specific company details or actionable events.
            - Example: "The Indonesian central bank noted that inflation has remained stable for the past quarter. Global commodity prices have seen slight fluctuations this week."

            Tier 2: Notable Event (Score 41-70)
            - Description: The news reports on a specific IDX-listed company or a direct policy change affecting a specific sector. 
              It describes a concrete event like a new project, a strategic partnership, management changes, or an analyst's rating update. 
              This tier is for news that is clearly relevant and noteworthy for tracking.
            - Example: "PT Aneka Tambang (ANTM) announced it is exploring a new partnership to develop an EV battery ecosystem. The company's stock rose 2% on the news."

            Tier 3: Critical & Actionable (Score 71-100)
            - Description: The news reports on a major, market-moving event for a specific IDX-listed company. These are high-impact events that investors often act on immediately.
            - Keywords to look for:
                - Merger / Acquisition (M&A)
                - Earnings Report (especially with results like "beat expectations" or "missed targets")
                - Dividend Announcement (especially with specific rates or dates)
                - Stock Buyback / Rights Issue
                - Major Insider Trading (large buy/sell by executives)
                - A government contract awarded or a major regulatory approval/rejection.
            - Example: "PT GoTo Gojek Tokopedia (GOTO) reported a 30% revenue jump in its Q2 2025 earnings, significantly beating forecasts. The company also announced a 1 trillion rupiah stock buyback program to boost shareholder value."
